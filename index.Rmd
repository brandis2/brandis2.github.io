Hello!  
I am **Brandi Patrice Smith** and I am currently a doctoral student at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu) in the [Informatics](https://www.informatics.illinois.edu) program. My research focuses on understanding how phthalate exposure in menopausal women effects health outcomes. I plan to use "machine learning" approaches to tackle this issue. This website is dedicated to showcasing my academic journey as well as my journey as a data scientist. My goal is to increase my data science skills alongside completing my dissertation over the next year.
