Hello!  

I am **Brandi Patrice Smith** and I am currently a [Steven M. Teutsch Prevention Effectiveness/Public Health Analytics Modeling Fellow](https://www.cdc.gov/pef/fellows/analytics-fellows.html) at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov).  


I received my PhD at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu) in the [Informatics](https://www.informatics.illinois.edu) program. I worked with epidemiologist and veterinarian Dr. Rebecca Lee Smith and her [Modeling for Disease Control Improvement lab](https://vetmed.illinois.edu/mdci/lab-team/) on understanding how phthalate exposure in menopausal women effects health outcomes.  

I am soooo passionate about data science, math, and statistics that I started an e-learning platform called [Data Science Academy](https://twitter.com/datasci_academy) dedicated to teaching high school students to code and prepare for data science careers!
