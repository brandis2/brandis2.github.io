## Data Visualization Project
These projects were conducted while completing a data mining specialization at Coursera. Data visualization is an essential and foundational step in understanding data - especially since most people are visual learners. The projects were well thought out and are meant to be clear enough for a young high school student to understand. Enjoy!
